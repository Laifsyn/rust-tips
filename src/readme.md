Hello. This is an attempt to compile tips/advices/tricks when/while using Rust.

Disclaimer: I did close to no effort to research if someone else is already compiling "tips and or tricks" for Rust. If you know of such a repository, please let me know so to hide some boilerplate from the internet, and learn new tricks.
